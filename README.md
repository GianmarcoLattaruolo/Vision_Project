# Vision and Cognitive Systems - Project
## Geolocalization from images

In this project related to the course "Vision and Cognitive Systems" held by professor L. Ballan we tryed build a machine learning model to predict the GPS coordinates from a image. We mainly followed the work by MÃ¼ller-Budack, Eric and Pustu-Iren, Kader and Ewerth, Ralph : "Geolocation Estimation of Photos Using a Hierarchical Model and Scene Classification" (https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation) .
